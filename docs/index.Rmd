This page shows my notes for setting up JupyterHubs on various platforms. What is a JupyterHub? Read about why cloud computing environments are great: [SnowEx 2022](https://snowex-2022.hackweek.io/preliminary/jupyterhub.html)

## Test JHub

I have set us up a JHub with RStudio on Azure. It's on Kubernetes and will spin up VMs as needed. The VMs are not huge: 2CPU & 8 Gig RAM.

Contact Eli if you want to test it out. See instructions under [JHub User Guide](JHub-User-Guide.html)

## Installation instructions

The other tabs to the left are my JHub installation notes for various platforms.
