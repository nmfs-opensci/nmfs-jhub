## Finding core files

These are big and storage is expensive.

```
find / -iname 'core.[0-9]*'
```

Then delete them.

## List kernels

```
jupyter kernelspec list
```

Remove

```
jupyter kernelspec remove <kernel_name>
```
if the kernel is not in the usual place use something like this to remove
```
jupyter kernelspec remove -p /home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/kernels notebook
```

Create a kernel

```
# make sure ipykernel is in your env
conda install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name mykernel
```
