Attempting to replicate the Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub: https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/tree/master/config/clusters/openscapes\nThat hub is on AWS and is designed for large workshops (100+) however the NMFS OpenSci JHub is quite similar. Main difference at the moment is that I don’t have a shared drive set-up and the user persistent volume (storage) is on the same VM as the user node for their Jupyter Notebook. This means that I cannot have multiple VM sizes. Need to fix so that user can pick a larger VM for a task if needed."

Don’t know what resource group to use, ask the admins.\nYou need to give your Kubernetes cluster a name. For example, jhub or daskhub or whatever.\nYou need to chose the AWS region. If you are using AWS S3 file access (big data in the cloud), then you need to be on the same region as the files you are accessing. Do you have no idea? Then you are probably not using AWS S3 file access. In that case, just go with the default or something close to you.\nNext you chose the “Node size”. This is the size of the base virtural machine (VM). It is going to spin up as many as it needs. The default is Standard DS2 v2 which as 2 CPU, 7 Gig RAM and 1T memory. This is fine for set-up. You can add more (bigger VMs later). Accept autoscaling since this is a multi-user hub.\n\nThe first tab is all you need for now. Later you may want to allow the user, to choose a different base VM. You can do that by adding node-pools. That’ll be covered after the initial set-up. For now, just get your basic hub working. You can add more VM sizes later.\n\nClick “Review and Create”\n\nWait for validation tests to pass.\n\nClick “Create”.\n\nOnce it is done deploying, you will see this."

We will use a docker image to “spawn” the user environment. Read here for other approaches.\nWe are going to use dockerspawner so that we can use a docker image for our user environments. The user will work in these containerized environments and they won’t have access to any other files in the server. In order to share their work with others, the normal workflow would be to work in Git repos and share those repos to a GitHub (or GitLab server). Each user will have a home directory on the server for their files, but they won’t have access to other hub user directories nor will they have access to any other directories on the server.\n\nCheck that the versions of jupyterhub match\nThe image that we use must have the jupyterhub module installed and the version of jupyterhub on your server must match that in the image.\nCheck the version on your server:\njupyterhub -V\nFor demo purposes, we will use the jupyter/scipy-notebook images on DockerHub. We want to find an image with the same version of jupyterhub as we have on our server.\n\n\nEdit the config file\nEdit the jupyterhub_config.py file in $JHUB-ENV/etc/jupyterhub/ to add that we want to use DockerSpawner and specify the image. Add these lines to jupyterhub_config.py.\nc.JupyterHub.spawner_class = 'dockerspawner.DockerSpawner'\nc.DockerSpawner.image = 'jupyter/scipy-notebook:67b8fb91f950'"
