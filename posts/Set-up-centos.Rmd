  Setting up a multi-user JupyterHub on Centos 7 VM
---

This is my notes for setting this up on a Centos 8 (Linux distribution) server. Jump to the "Summary" section to see only the instructions without explanations.

**All the commands are run in a shell (bash)**

References:

* <https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/1.2.0/installation-guide-hard.html> This is an old version (1.2.0) while the newest verson of JupyterHub is 4+. However the 4+ docs do not cover a simple bare metal (own server installation).
* <https://jupyterhub-dockerspawner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>

## Set up VM on Azure

* Created a Centos 8.3 server on Azure: https://portal.azure.com/#create/cloud-infrastructure-services.centos-8-3centos-8-3
* I didn't do anything special for set-up. Choose SSH with key.
* Once it is created, I went to the dashboard and selected my VM. The dashboard has a "Connect" button to get to the shell and it shows the public IP address.
* I had to create a special security rule to allow me to ssh into the public IP address to connect. Normally I use the cloud shell to connect, but Azure would not let me connect via the cloud shell for a server since it wanted upgraded security package and I cannot do that with my work subscription.
* Then I saved the key somewhere on my computer and
```{bash eval=FALSE}
chmod 400 ~/<key location>
ssh -i ~/<key location>/Centos8.cer <vm-username>@<public ip-address>
```

<!--
ssh -i ~/Downloads/Centos8.cer eeholmes@20.127.203.178
-->

## On VM check set-up

I ssh-ed into the VM with
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ssh -i <path to key downloaded from Azure> eeholmes@<public ip address>
```

### Make sure you are root

Getting the JupyterHub set up needs to be done as root. First make sure you have an admin password. When I set up my Azure VM, I did not set a password. So first
```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo passwd <your username>
```
and set a password. Then switch to root if you are not signed in as root
```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo -i
```

### Check for Python

You will need Python 3.6+ installed. Open a terminal window and run 
`python3 --version` or `python --version` to see if Python is installed and what the version is.

Check your operating system (OS) with
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat /etc/os-release
```

### Check for conda

You will need conda (or miniconda) for these instructions. conda (and miniconda) take care of checking that all our packages will be inter-operable. It is best to install JupyterHub into a clean environment. That way you minimize chances of conflicts and your environment will solve (figure out any conflicts) much much faster.

Check for conda with
```{bash eval=FALSE}
conda list
```
If it doesn't show a list of environments, then you need to install miniconda.
[Installation instructions](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/). Read about miniconda for scientists from Software Carpentries  [here](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists/setup/).

This is what I used to install miniconda from [these instructions](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/index.html#quick-command-line-install). Note install miniconda in some place like `/opt/miniconda3` where all users will have access to ``/opt/miniconda3/bin`. We don't want to install in `/root/` for example or the admin users home directory.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
mkdir -p /opt/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O /opt/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash /opt/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p /opt/miniconda3
rm -rf /opt/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
```

Then initialize to set up the path. Note I am using bash. You'll need to change if you are using zsh.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
/opt/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

*note will need to do something else to add the conda binary to all the users' paths*

## Create the conda environment

Create the conda environment for the jupyterhub installation. Installation will be in a directory with all the files for packages. Then activate it (enter it), and get the location of the environment (folder).

*All the commands below are in the terminal window on your VM/server.*

Create the environment named `jupyterhub` with python and jupyterhub (module).  After creating, activate (enter) that environment. Then install jupyterlab, notebook and dockerspawner into the environment. Note the `jupyterhub` after `-n` is the name of the environment.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
conda create -n jupyterhub python
```
Then activate (enter) that environment
```{bash eval=FALSE}
conda activate jupyterhub
```
Then install jupyterhub here
```{bash eval=FALSE}
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterhub
```
and then jupyterlab
```{bash eval=FALSE}
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab notebook
```

### Set a variable for env path

The environment has a folder with all the packages and binaries that we install. We are going to need to know the location of that folder. Get the location with
```{bash eval=FALSE}
conda env list
```
On the VM I set up, the folder location is 
```{bash eval=FALSE}
/opt/miniconda3/envs/jupyterhub
```
Yours could be something entirely different. On another server with anaconda (a not-free conda package resolver), the folder was
```{bash eval=FALSE}
/SHARE/anaconda3/envs/jupterhub/
```
We are going to be saving the configuration files for our JupyterHub in this folder. Let's save the path to a variable so we don't have to keep entering the whole path.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
JHUBENV=/opt/miniconda3/envs/jupyterhub
```

Make sure users can read and execute this folder. They need to in order to be able to spawn instances for the hub.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
chmod 755 $JHUBENV
```

You should now be able to start the hub, but you will not be able to access it yet because you need to open the 8000 port. Type 
```{bash eval=FALSE}
$JHUBENV/bin/jupyterhub
```
and check that it starts. Then use Cntl-C to stop the hub.

## Create a user on the VM

By default, any user on the server will be able to login. Let's create a test user so that we are not logging into our hub with the root user password. We will be using "http" until we secure it so passwords are potentially exposed.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
useradd jhub
```
and give it a password when it asks.

## Open the 8000 port

FirewallD was not running on my Azure Centos server, so I started it up to manage the ports.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo systemctl enable firewalld
sudo systemctl start firewalld
```

Find out the Public IP address for the server you are on; it's listed on the Azure overview and networking page for the VM in the Azure portal. Then open the 8000 port.

First find out what ports are open through the firewall
```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo firewall-cmd --list-ports
```
Add the 8000 port, reload and recheck that it appears.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo firewall-cmd  --permanent --add-port 8000/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
sudo firewall-cmd --list-ports
```

Because I am on an Azure VM, I also have to set up a networking rule to allow the 8000 port. By default, all public access to the server is blocked. Go to the Azure dashboard, select your VM, then select Networking under Settings, and then click Add Inbound Port rule. I am pretty sure you need to select "http" instead of "https".

Once the port is open, you should be able to reach your JupyterHub at `http://XXX.XX.XX.XX:8000` (replace the XX's with the Public IP address). 

*Background* 

The JupyterhHub is running by default on `http://localhost:8000`. This means that if you start the hub on a machine that you are logged into, you should be able to open a browser on that machine, enter `http://localhost:8000` and the hub login page will appear. There are a few reasons that might not work

* You are ssh-ing into a server and don't have a browser to open. The browser on the computer that you are ssh-ing from is the "localhost" in this case and you need the "localhost" to be the server.
* You are logged directly into your server, but it doesn't have a browser installed.

However `http://localhost:8000` is actually not very useful. We are trying to create a hub that others can log into from their browsers.

So you need to determine the Public IP address for the server you are on. This is the IP address that you could enter into a browser. If you enter `http://XXX.XX.XX.XX` (replace with actual IP), then you should see a page of some sort. This indicates that the server is working. If you are on an internal network, then you will only be able to load the address if you are also on that network. But for security reason, ports will not be open by default. You need to open the 8000 port so that `http://XXX.XX.XX.XX:8000` will be found.

## Log in!

At this point, you should be able to login with the `jhub` test account.

## Set up a configuration file

So far, we have started the hub with the default configuration. We are going to need to customize it. For that we need a configuration file. We will create this in the folder where the environment files are.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo mkdir -p $JHUBENV/etc/jupyterhub/
cd $JHUBENV/etc/jupyterhub/
```

Next create the default configuration file `jupyterhub_config.py`.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo $JHUBENV/bin/jupyterhub --generate-config
```
Because we `cd`-d into the `$JHUBENV/etc/jupyterhub/` directory, the file is created there. This default file is very long. Open up with
```{bash eval=FALSE}
nano jupyterhub_config.py
```
Use F6 to find lines. Uncomment these two lines and save (Cntl-O, Enter, Cntl-X).
```{bash eval=FALSE}
c.Spawner.http_timeout = 3600
```

## Make a new server service

### Create the new unit file

At this point, after opening the port, you should be able to get to your JupyterHub by starting it with `jupyterhub --ip XXX.XX.XX.XX --port=8000` and then browsing to `http://XXX.XX.XX.XX:8000`. But you hub is going to be stopped whenever the server is rebooted. So next we need to set up a service for your service so that our hub starts automatically.

Create a new directory for the service unit file, 
```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo mkdir -p $JHUBENV/etc/systemd
cd $JHUBENV/etc/systemd
```
Create the file and name `jupyterhub.service`. For example, using nano editor, we do
```{bash eval=FALSE}
nano jupyterhub.service
```
And into that file we put the following. Replace `/opt/miniconda3/envs/jupyterhub` with the actual path to the jupyterhub environment folder.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
[Unit]
Description=JupyterHub
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
User=root
Environment="PATH=/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/opt/miniconda3/envs/jupyterhub/bin"
ExecStart=/opt/miniconda3/envs/jupyterhub/bin/jupyterhub -f /opt/miniconda3/envs/jupyterhub/etc/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.py

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Next we make systemd aware of the new service. 

Create a symlink file in the folder where all the server services are kept. And tell `systemd` to reload its configuration files
```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo ln -s $JHUBENV/etc/systemd/jupyterhub.service /etc/systemd/system/jupyterhub.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

### Make sure SELinux doesn't block our service

SELinux (security for the server) checks that files that are used have the correct label. All our files have generic file labels. If you do,
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ls -Z $JHUBENV/etc/systemd/
```
You will see that the file label is `unconfined_u:object_r:usr_t:s0`. We need it to be
```{bash eval=FALSE}
systemd_unit_file_t
```
We change the file label with
```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo chcon system_u:object_r:systemd_unit_file_t:s0 $JHUBENV/etc/systemd/jupyterhub.service
```

SELinux will also object to the file label on all the binaries that we use to start up the JupyterHub (like `jupyterhub`) so we need to fix those file labels.

This will add `bin_t` label to all the binaries and check that it worked.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo find $JHUBENV/bin -type f -exec chcon system_u:object_r:bin_t:s0 {} \;
ls -Z $JHUBENV/bin
```
It got all the binaries but not the simlinks. Nonetheless it seemed to run ok.

### Enable our new service

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo systemctl enable jupyterhub.service
```

The service will start on reboot, but we can start it straight away using `start`:
```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo systemctl start jupyterhub.service
```
Check that it is running.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo systemctl status jupyterhub.service
```
If it fails, try 
```{bash eval=FALSE}
audit2why < /var/log/audit/audit.log
```
to debug. It is likely to be an issue with SELinux blocking the service from starting.

Now our hub should be available on `http:\\XXX.XX.XX.XX:8000`. You can double check that it is listen on this port by running
```{bash eval=FALSE}
netstat -tuln
```
At this point, you will need to address security if your hub is open to the web, as opposed to being on an internal network and only accessible to that network. Learn about that [here](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/1.2.0/installation-guide-hard.html).

## Set up Docker for user environment

When you log in the jupyter notebooks will be trying to use the Python environment that was created to install JupyterHub, this is not what we want. We will use a docker image to "spawn" the user environment. Read  [here](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/1.2.0/installation-guide-hard.html#part-2-conda-environments) for other approaches.

We are going to use [dockerspawner](https://jupyterhub-dockerspawner.readthedocs.io/) so that we can use a docker image for our user environments. The user will work in these containerized environments and they won't have access to any other files in the server. In order to share their work with others, the normal workflow would be to work in Git repos and share those repos to a GitHub (or GitLab server). Each user will have a home directory on the server for their files, but they won't have access to other hub user directories nor will they have access to any other directories on the server.

### Install docker

I am using Centos in this example

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo yum install -y yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
```

Then we need to start docker
```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo systemctl start docker
```

### Install dockerspawner

I am going to be creating the user environment from a docker image, so I also want dockerspawner.  Note dockerspawner installed docker-py but it was really old and threw errors so I installed separately to get the latest version. Note make sure you are in the jupyterhub conda env. You can run `conda env list` and use `conda activate jupyterhub` if you are not in it.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
conda install -c conda-forge dockerspawner
conda install -c conda-forge docker-py
```

### Jupyter images

The image that we use must have the jupyterhub and notebook module installed. The jupyterhub version needs to also match what you have on your hub.

Check the version on your server:
```{bash eval=FALSE}
$JHUBENV/bin/jupyterhub -V
```
For demo purposes, we will use the `jupyter` images on DockerHub. We want to find an image with the same version of jupyterhub as we have on our server.

### Edit the config file

Edit the `jupyterhub_config.py` file in `$JHUB-ENV/etc/jupyterhub/` to add that we want to use DockerSpawner and specify the images that users should have access to. Users will get a drop down menu. Add these lines to `jupyterhub_config.py`. The hub bind url needs to be 0.0.0.0 because we are using a docker container for the individual user environments.

* https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/whats-the-main-difference-between-hub-connect-url-vs-hub-bind-url/3596/2
* Note `image_whitelist` [is deprecated](https://jupyterhub-dockerspawner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html#dockerspawner.DockerSpawner.allowed_images) as of dockerspawner 12.0. New name is `allowed_images`.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
c = get_config()  #noqa
c.JupyterHub.port = 8000
c.JupyterHub.hub_bind_url = "http://0.0.0.0:8081"
c.JupyterHub.spawner_class = 'dockerspawner.DockerSpawner'
c.DockerSpawner.remove = True
c.Spawner.http_timeout = 3600
c.DockerSpawner.image_whitelist = {
    'datascience-r': 'jupyter/datascience-notebook:r-4.3.1',
    'scipy-notebook': 'jupyter/scipy-notebook:7e1a19a8427f',
}
```

Do a docker pull of the images so that they don't have to be pulled the first time that a user chooses that image.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
docker pull jupyter/datascience-notebook:r-4.3.1
docker pull jupyter/scipy-notebook:7e1a19a8427f
```

Now you can restart the service and the user can start a notebook with the specified images.

### Create your own Docker images

Docker images that work with JupyterHub with Kubernetes will work with this set-up with the addition of jupyterhub and notebook.

Add the following to your Docker image
```{bash eval=FALSE}
RUN pip3 install \
    'jupyter-rsession-proxy' \
    'jupyterhub==3.1.*' \
    'notebook==6.*' \
    'jupyterlab'

CMD ["jupyterhub-singleuser"]
```

Example using rocker image. Code added to make the home directory `home/jovyan`.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
FROM rocker/binder:4.3

USER root
RUN usermod -d /home/jovyan rstudio
RUN mkdir /home/jovyan
RUN chown rstudio:rstudio /home/jovyan
USER rstudio

RUN pip3 install \
    'jupyter-rsession-proxy' \
    'jupyterhub==3.1.*' \
    'notebook==6.*' \
    'jupyterlab'

WORKDIR /home/jovyan

CMD ["jupyterhub-singleuser"]
```

Example using openscapes/rocker
```{bash eval=FALSE}
FROM openscapes/rocker:a7596b5

RUN pip3 install \
    'jupyter-rsession-proxy' \
    'jupyterhub==3.1.*' \
    'notebook==6.*' \
    'jupyterlab'

USER root
RUN mkdir /home/jovyan
RUN chown rstudio:rstudio /home/jovyan
USER rstudio

CMD ["jupyterhub-singleuser"]
```

### Special note regarding rocker images

The default home directory for rocker images is `home/rstudio` but the default for JupyterHub is `home/jovyan`. 


## Persistent volume

Add the following to the config file to create a persistent volume.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
notebook_dir = '/home/jovyan'
c.DockerSpawner.notebook_dir = notebook_dir

# Mount the real user's Docker volume on the host to the notebook user's
# notebook directory in the container
c.DockerSpawner.volumes = { 'jupyter-{username}': notebook_dir }
```

## User environment customization

### Memory limits and guarantees

You can set memory limits on the containers that are spawned for users by adding limits. Read the documentation [here](https://jupyterhub-dockerspawner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html#dockerspawner.DockerSpawner.mem_limit).

For example:
```{bash eval=FALSE}
c.DockerSpawner.mem_limit = '8G'
c.DockerSpawner.mem_guarantee = '1G'
c.DockerSpawner.cpu_guarantee = 0.5
c.DockerSpawner.cpu_limit = 1
```

If that doesn't work try
```{bash eval=FALSE}
c.Spawner.mem_limit = '2G'
```

I believe you can specify as a drop-down to give the user choices:
```{bash eval=FALSE}
c.DockerSpawner.mem_guarantee = {
    '1G': '1G',
    '2G': '2G',
    '8G': '8G',
}
```

### Creating a shared volume

One read-only shared volume:

<https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner/issues/172>

```{bash eval=FALSE}
c.DockerSpawner.volumes = {  'jupyterhub-{username}':'/home/jovyan',   '/path/to/shared': {"bind": '/home/jovyan/shared', "mode": "ro"} }
```

A volume that is read-only for some and read-write for others:

<https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner/issues/172>

More discussions around shared volumes

<https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner/issues/453>

## Setting up https

If you are using a public IP address, rather than being on a private network, you need to set up https so that content (passwords and everything else) is not visible. Read how to do that [here](Set-up-centos-security.html).

These instructions set up this url: `https://dhub.bluemountain123.live`


## GitHub authentication

**After** you have https set-up, we can set up authentication via a GitHub teams in a GitHub organization. Read other ways to authenticate (create users) [here](https://oauthenticator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/provider-specific-setup/).

https://oauthenticator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/provider-specific-setup/providers/github.html


### Create a new Oauth Application on GitHub

This Oauth application is going to be associated with your (personal) GitHub account, but you will use a team on a GitHub organization that you are owner of for the users who are allowed to log into your JupyterHub.

Log into GitHub and go to GitHub \> Settings \> Developer Settings \> New Oauth Application

Look carefully at how I filled in the boxes. Change the URL and the name of the application.

![](../images/img10.png)

Next you will see something like this

![](../images/img11.png)

You need to copy the ID and then click the create secrets button and save the secret. You will need those in the next step.

### Create a team in your GitHub organization

You will be added by default and add anyone else who needs access to the hub. Let's say your GitHub organization is MyOrg and the team is called JHub. So then the allowed organization is MyOrg:JHub. You can leave off :JHub if you want to allow all members of the organization to log in.

### Install 

Install the oauthenticator package. Make sure you are in the jupyterhub conda environment.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# check what environment you are in and switch if needed
# conda env list
# conda activate jupyterhub
conda install -c conda-forge oauthenticator
```

### Edit the `jupyterhub_config.py` file

Edit with something like

```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd /opt/miniconda3/envs/jupyterhub/etc/jupyterhub/
nano jupyterhub_config.py
```

Add these info. Replace the id, secret, url and admin user with your values. Adding an admin user is handy because then you can do some basic management of the hub. Read more [here](https://oauthenticator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/api/gen/oauthenticator.github.html#module-oauthenticator.github).

```         
c.JupyterHub.authenticator_class = "github"
c.OAuthenticator.oauth_callback_url = "https://dhub.bluemountain123.live/hub/oauth_callback"
c.OAuthenticator.client_id = "your oauth2 application id"
c.OAuthenticator.client_secret = "your oauth2 application secret"
c.GitHubOAuthenticator.allowed_organizations = {"MyOrg:JHub"}
c.GitHubOAuthenticator.scope = ["read:org"]
c.GitHubOAuthenticator.admin_users = {"eeholmes"}
```

### Restart the hub

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo systemctl stop jupyterhub.service
sudo systemctl start jupyterhub.service
```

Now any member you add to the GitHub organization team should be able to log in.

If you run into trouble, try

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo systemctl status jupyterhub.service
```

Make sure SELinux doesn't block our service
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ls -Z $JHUBENV/etc/systemd/
sudo chcon system_u:object_r:systemd_unit_file_t:s0 $JHUBENV/etc/systemd/jupyterhub.service
sudo find $JHUBENV/bin -type f -exec chcon system_u:object_r:bin_t:s0 {} \;
```

Enable our new service
```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo ln -s $JHUBENV/etc/systemd/jupyterhub.service /etc/systemd/system/jupyterhub.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable jupyterhub.service
sudo systemctl start jupyterhub.service
```

Done! See the long instructions if anything is not working.

Now go through the https and GitHub authentication steps if you need that.
