  Securing our JupyterHub on our Centos server
---

Now that our basic JupyterHub is running, we want to secure it. We are going to use Let's Encrypt. Prerequisites:

* We need to have set up a domain (URL) that points to the public IP of our JupyterHub
* We need to ssh into our server and have `sudo` access
* We need to open port 80 (temporarily)

## Create a domain name

Find a domain name provider and set one up. It is not expensive. I used GoDaddy. You only need one. Later you can use it for multiple hubs using subdomains where are created by the next step (DNS entry). For example, let's say you get the domain `bluemountain123.live`. You can have as many subdomains as you want and they will be `subdomain.bluemountain123.live`.

### Create a DNS entry

Let's pretend you set up `bluemountain123.live` as the domain. Go to the DNS settings for your domain. Add a type A record. This will do 2 things. First this will create the subdomain that you will use to access your JupyterHub. So let's say you create, `dhub` as the type A DNS entry. Put `dhub` in the name and the public IP address of the server (leaving off `:8000`) in the value section. Then `dhub.bluemountain123.live` will be the url.

### Test if the url is working

`http://dhub.bluemountain123.live:8000` would be the url using the example domain above. Test that it is working (shows a JupyterHub login) before moving on. This is what you should see:

## Prep the server

### Open port 80

This is the default port for http and certbot is going to spin up a temporary webserver on this port and get the SSL certificates. We will close this port when we are done.

* Go to the Azure dashboard (Networking section) for your CentOS server and make sure port 80 is open.
* Check that the firewall is not blocking port 80: `sudo firewall-cmd --list-ports`. If 80 is not listed, we need to add it and reload:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo firewall-cmd  --permanent --add-port 80/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
sudo firewall-cmd --list-ports
```

### Stop our JupyterHub

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo systemctl start jupyterhub.service
```

## Install certbot

Per Let's Encrypt recommendations, we will use certbot  to get our SSL certificates. <https://certbot.eff.org/>.

Here are the instructions for certbot on CentOS 8: <https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=other&os=centosrhel8> We choose "other" as the software.

### Update the CentOS repos

I am using an End-of-Life CentOS distribution (sigh), and the repositories have been archived. This [solution](https://forums.centos.org/viewtopic.php?f=54&t=78708#p330705) worked.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
dnf --disablerepo '*' --enablerepo=extras swap centos-linux-repos centos-stream-repos
dnf distro-sync
```

Note the last line, suggesting updating a bunch of packages and I said NO to that.

### Install snap

Per instructions here: <https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snap-on-centos> This updated some SELinux packages, which seemed a bit alarming but nothing seemed to break.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo yum install snapd
sudo systemctl enable --now snapd.socket
sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap
```

### Install certbot

I had to run this twice. First time it complained.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
```

### Create the SSL certs.

Have certbot create the SSL certs by spinning up a temporary webserver listening on port 80. Per instructions on the certbot website.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo certbot certonly --standalone
```

It'll ask for your email and the URL of your website. In my toy example, I created the domain `dhub.bluemountain123.live`.

### SSL cert renewal

With certbot running, the certificates should auto renew, but I haven't tested this.


## Update the JupyterHub config file

Edit with something like

```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd /opt/miniconda3/envs/jupyterhub/etc/jupyterhub/
nano jupyterhub_config.py
```

Then add this to the config file. The port that is configured for SSL by default is 443. https is not going to work on 8000 which we had configured for http (on Azure). 

```   
c.JupyterHub.port = 443
c.JupyterHub.ssl_key = '/etc/letsencrypt/live/dhub.bluemountain123.live/privkey.pem'
c.JupyterHub.ssl_cert = '/etc/letsencrypt/live/dhub.bluemountain123.live/fullchain.pem'
```


### Restart and Test

We need to open 443 in the firewall, and we can close 80 and 8000 now.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo firewall-cmd  --permanent --add-port 443/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd  --permanent --remove-port=80/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd  --permanent --remove-port=8000/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
sudo firewall-cmd --list-ports
```

Next we restart our JupyterHub service.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo systemctl start jupyterhub.service
```

Try `https://dhub.bluemountain123.live` and you should see the JupyterHub login without the http warning.
